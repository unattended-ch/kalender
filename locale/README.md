## kalender.po language translation

    The translation for de and fr is finished.
    All other languages are unfinished.

#### Original file for translation
    ./kalender.po

#### Translated files
    ./kalender.xx.po

    xx = Language short code en, de, fr ...

#### Translating .po files
    - I use poedit for tranlations.
#####    You have to install [poedit]  package from ubuntu or debian
    - When you edit the .po file always copy original text and replace english with your
      language to preserve formatting.

    - Please send me your .po files back for integration in the installer package

#### Thank you in advance for your contribution!
